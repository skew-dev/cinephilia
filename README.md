## What's Cinephilia?
Cinephilia is all about sharing the love of movies. Our objective with this project is to provide a community where cinephiles can share their movie reviews with each other.

## Technical Description
Our project is focused on the creation of a REST API, which handles a dataset of movies with their respective attributes. Most importantly, the API will also handle movie reviews. All of this will be implemented via CRUD operations using popular and well-tested open source frameworks. The project will also have a frontend that will consume the API, and it is intended as the only place where users can interact with the system.

## Users
Our main users are those people who love watching movies, but most importantly, those who like talking about them and discussing them with their friends. We plan to provide a community where they can meet and interact with likeminded users, where they can share their thoughts on movies they like (or maybe the ones they dislike) or even find completely new movies they have never heard of.
