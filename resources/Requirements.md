# Requirements
This project was designed to test our Software Development abilities, so our mentors chose most of the requirements. Nonetheless, we did have to define and prioritize them, as it is a crucial part of our process.

## Functional Requirements
### User Requirements
The user must be able to perform the following:
* Browse through the entire movie catalogue.
* Access a specific movie’s written reviews.
* Register and login into their account.
* Add a new movie to the movie catalogue.
* Write a review for a specific movie that exists in the catalogue.
* Edit and delete any of their previous reviews.

### System Requirements
* Provide access to the movie catalogue and user reviews to any user, even if they are not logged in to the system.
* Only allow logged in users to review a movie.
* Only allow authorized users to add a new movie to the movie catalogue.

## Prioritization Technique
To prioritize the requirements of Cinephilia we used the **MoSCoW** technique. This technique categorizes the requirements in four different levels of overall value to the project.

### Must
* Indispensable tasks, features and to-do's to achieve the success of Cinephilia.
### Should
* Important tasks, features and to-do's that are valuable for Cinephilia and contribute to the success of the project.
### Could
* Tasks, features or to-do's that are desirable but not necessary. These requirements will only be considered after completing the previous two types.
### Will not
* Secondary tasks, features or to-do's that will not be implemented in the near future but could be interesting to have eventually. Cinephilia does not use this type of prioritizing category.
