This project was designed to test our Software Development abilities, so our mentors chose most of the requirements. Nonetheless, we did have to define and prioritize them, as it is a crucial part of our process.

## Functional Requirements
### User Requirements
The user must be able to perform the following:
* Browse through the entire movie catalogue.
* Access a specific movieâ€™s written reviews.
* Register and login into their account.
* Add a new movie to the movie catalogue.
* Write a review for a specific movie that exists in the catalogue.
* Edit and delete any of their previous reviews.

### System Requirements
* Provide access to the movie catalogue and user reviews to any user, even if they are not logged in to the system.
* Only allow logged in users to review a movie.
* Only allow authorized users to add a new movie to the movie catalogue.

## Prioritization Technique
To prioritize the requirements of Cinephilia we used the **MoSCoW** technique. This technique categorizes the requirements in four different levels of overall value to the project.

### Must
* Indispensable tasks, features and to-do's to achieve the success of Cinephilia.
### Should
* Important tasks, features and to-do's that are valuable for Cinephilia and contribute to the success of the project.
### Could
* Tasks, features or to-do's that are desirable but not necessary. These requirements will only be considered after completing the previous two types.
### Will not
* Secondary tasks, features or to-do's that will not be implemented in the near future but could be interesting to have eventually. Cinephilia does not use this type of prioritizing category.
