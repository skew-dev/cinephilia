# Requirements
This project was designed to test our Software Development abilities, so our mentors chose most of the requirements. Nonetheless, we did have to define and prioritize them, as it is a crucial part of our process.

## Functional Requirements
* The user must be able to browse the entire movie catalogue.
* The user must be able to add a new movie.
* The user must be able to review a movie.
* The user must be able to rate a movie.
* The user must be able to update or delete any of their reviews.
* The user could have a public profile where their reviews are shown.
* The user should be able to register and login into the platform via third party services.
* The user should be able to mark another user's review as useful or not useful.
* A user could see another userâ€™s profile and browse through their reviews.

## Prioritization Technique
To prioritize the requirements of Cinephilia we used the **MoSCoW** technique. This technique categorizes the requirements in four different levels of overall value to the project.

### Must
* Indispensable tasks, features and to-do's to achieve the success of Cinephilia.
### Should
* Important tasks, features and to-do's that are valuable for Cinephilia and contribute to the success of the project.
### Could
* Tasks, features or to-do's that are desirable but not necessary. These requirements will only be considered after completing the previous two types.
### Will not
* Secondary tasks, features or to-do's that will not be implemented in the near future but could be interesting to have eventually. Cinephilia does not use this type of prioritizing category.
