# Team Work
## Team Roles
The roles were assigned according to each member's technical abilities, considering that some members have more practice with coding than others. Because of this, we organized ourselves in such a manner so that the experienced members can lead the less experienced ones with ease. Also, we wanted every single member to learn something that they like, so each one of us had the freedom to choose which technology they wanted to work with.
* **Manuel Antonio Cituk Martínez:** Team leader - DevOps
* **Jorge Teodoro Dawn Rodríguez:** Backend development (Authentication/Authorization)
* **Rodrigo Alejandro Castrejón Cervantes:** Overall backend development
* **Gabriel Nayib Castul Lazo:** Frontend development
* **Daniel Pliego Vega:** Frontend design and development

## Responsibilities and Contributions
To assign tasks and responsibilities, first, we discuss and define the feature of the project that we want to implement. Then, as a team, we break down said feature into multiple tasks. Because not every task has the same amount of difficulty, the leader assigns the proper amount of tasks to each member, so at the end, we have a similar amount of work and overall contribution.

For the organization and assignment of tasks, we use GitHub's *project boards*. This tool allows us to add our tasks as GitHub issues, then, we assign each *issue* to its corresponding member. The advantage of using *project boards* and *issues* is that everything stays in this repository. There is no need to use external tools and go back and forth. Besides that, as the project progresses, we leave behind historical evidence of every single *issue* that someone finalized. That is because *issues* don't disappear. They are simply closed and referenced in commit messages for everyone to see.
