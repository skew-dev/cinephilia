# Work Process
## Methodology
Throughout the project, we will use the Kanban methodology focused on issue creation/completion within GitHub. For this, we will use GitHub's built-in tool for project management called *Project Boards* with Kanban templates. The advantage is that we are keeping everything in one place, also, it will keep a historical record of our progress and link it with our GitHub issues and branches. It will also serve as a way to track responsibilities and personal contributions.

## Communication
* **WhatsApp and Slack:** These are our main communication tools. WhatsApp provides instant messaging between the team members, which is extremely important in a project like ours, where everyone's input is necessary at all times. As for Slack, it is our main communication tool with our mentors, where we organize meetings with them and where we share our progress or questions with them.
* **Discord and Microsoft Teams:** We used them specifically for real-time meetings, where we share precise ideas that need explicit descriptions. We use Discord exclusively for in-team calls and Microsoft Teams for video-meetings with our mentors.
